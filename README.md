SATE2012 - Grid-In-A-Box
===================

Grid-In-A-Box is a project for [Summer At The Edge 2012](http://wbi-icc.com/centers-services/discovery-lab) to create a package that any person with basic IT skills (no previous OpenSim experience) can use to deploy a robust, stable [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org) grid, or a new region to join to an existing grid.

A large portion of the project is simply documentation, a "service manual" for configuring and maintaining a grid / region. There will also be a simi-graphical (ncurses-like) installation script for Linux and Windows, as well as support scripts to simplify administration.
